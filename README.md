## Multiclass Chest X-ray Classification using CNN-BiLSTM

This task creates a CNN and BiLSTM-based deep learning model architecture for classifying Chest X-Ray images into three classes.
- COVID19
- Pneumonia
- Normal
  
The model has been trained on the [COVID19+PNEUMONIA+NORMAL Chest X-Ray Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/covid-pneumonia-normal-chest-xray-images) from Kaggle. The dataset has been split into an *80: 10: 10* ratio for Train, Validation and Test sets. On the Test set, this model achieves an accuracy of **98.4704%** and an F1 score of **0.9847**.
